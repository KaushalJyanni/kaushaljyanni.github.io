      <title>N-Body Simulation Using CUDA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The project was mainly aimed at providing an introduction to parallel computing rather than designing an application. The basics and the core concepts of parallel computing were studied from a mooc at UDACITY. After the semester long learning we decided to create a simulator of n-body particles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In physics, the n-body problem is the problem of predicting the individual motions of a group of celestial objects interacting with each other gravitationally. The code was written in C++ and ran on CUDA (a parallel computing platform provided by NVIDIA) to increase the computational efficency which resulted in a great boosting compared to serial version of same code. The visualisation part was done on openCV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project provided a great insight into the GPU hardware and the domain of parallel computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the GitHub link for the repository of the code. Feel Free to contact me to know more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poisson Equation Solver</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer project was an intensive application of the concepts learned in the earlier n-body simulation project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim was to create a multi-grid solver for the Poissonâ€™s equation. The project was supervised by professor M.K. Verma. The existing serial code was changed into parallel approach to get the three dimension grid of unknown values in a Jacobian iterator method. The reason was the same that a parallel approach using GPUs could provide much greater computational speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belows is the link for the github repository of the code. Feel free to contact me to know more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
